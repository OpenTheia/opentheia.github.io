Recently we won the [James Dyson Award](jamesdysonaward.org/) at the national level for all of Canada!

We can't express how honoured we are to receive this award from Dyson, and are glad that they are choosing to support us as we work towards making touch screens accessible.

Here are a small selection of the articles written about this achievement:
