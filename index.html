              <p> <b>To create a product that will
                    allow a visually impaired person to interact with any
                    touch screen.</b> <br/>
                  Touch screens are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Airplanes, 
                  movie theatres, grocery stores, mall directories and more all use touch screens to 
                provide services. Unfortunately these touch screens often do not have 
                any accessible features for someone who is unable to clearly see 
                all of its elements. In general touch screens aren't accessible to someone who is visually impaired,
                and we aim to change that.
