              <p> <b>To create a product that will
                    allow a visually impaired person to interact with any
                    touch screen.</b> <br/>
                  Touch screens are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Airplanes, 
                  movie theatres, grocery stores, mall directories and more all use touch screens to 
                provide services. Unfortunately these touch screens often do not have 
                any accessible features for someone who is unable to clearly see 
                all of its elements. In general touch screens aren't accessible to someone who is visually impaired,
                and we aim to change that.

                Recently WatVision has become open source. The entirety of the source code is now available on Github under the MIT license. The goal 
                for this change was to ensure that the techonlogy would be available to any other developers who would want to
                pursue this project further, or add accessibility to their own projects.
