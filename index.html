              <p> <b>To create a product that will
                    allow a visually impaired person to interact with any
                    touch screen.</b> <br/>
                  Touch screens are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Airplanes, 
                  movie theatres, grocery stores, mall directories and more all use touch screens to 
                provide services. Unfortunately these touch screens often do not have 
                any accessible features for someone who is unable to clearly see 
                all of its elements. In general touch screens aren't accessible to someone who is visually impaired,
                and we aim to change that.

            <p>The WatVision team is made up of 6 fourth year Mechatronics Engineering students from
                the university of Waterloo. The team has a diverse background in different areas of technology
                such as software, electrical and mechanical engineering concepts. <br/>

            <p>WatVision aims to have a functional prototype in March 2018. Currently the team is designing, building
                and iterating upon different prototype designs.

            <p>If you are interested in helping this project, or just want to learn more please email the team at:
                <a href='mailto:watvision.team@gmail.com'>watvision.team@gmail.com</a> <br/>
                We are always looking to hear from someone who is visually impaired on how they interact with touch screens,
                and we use that feedback when we are evaluating different designs.
