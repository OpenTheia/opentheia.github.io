                <p> <b>To create a product that will
                        allow a visually impaired person to interact with any

                    Touch screens are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Airplanes,
                    movie theatres, grocery stores, mall directories and more all use touch screens to
                    provide services. Unfortunately these touch screens often do not have
                    any accessible features for someone who is unable to clearly see
                    all of its elements. In general touch screens aren't accessible to someone who is visually
                    impaired,
                    and we aim to change that.

                    The OpenTheia project is a continuation of the WatVision project. This project aims to expand on
                    the source code
                    created in the the original.
                    Originally this effort was part of a fourth year design project at the University of Waterloo.
                    The original team has now all graduated and moved to different companies and locations in the
                    world.
                    Two of its members decided to continue the project under a new name: OpenTheia.
